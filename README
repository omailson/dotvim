This is my personal vim configuration. Use it at your own risk.

INSTRUCTIONS
===============

I tried my best to make the installation process the simplest thing. Just
follow the instructions below:

First run the configure script and answer the questions.

$ ./configure.sh 

This will create a file called vimrc

Then compile command-t plugin

$ make commandt

Now you need to install.

WARNING: This will erase user's .vimrc

$ make symlink

PORTABLE
===============

You can use this configuration even when another vim environment is already set
to the user.
Just set the corresponding variable on your generated vimrc and open vim using
the command below:

$ vim -u vimrc

You'll probably enjoy this wonderful alias:

$ alias vim='vim -u /path/to/dotvim/vimrc --cmd "let g:dotvim_portable = 1"'
