This is my personal vim configuration. Use it at your own risk.

INSTRUCTIONS
===============

I tried my best to make the installation process the simplest thing. Just
follow the instructions below:

First run the configure script and answer the questions.

$ ./configure.sh 

This will create a file called dotvimrc.vim

Then compile command-t plugin

$ make commandt

Now you need to install.

WARNING: This will erase user's .vimrc

$ make symlink
